# Amazon_Clone
This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon India homepage, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the look and feel of Amazon’s landing page for learning and practice purposes. It includes a fully styled navigation bar, search bar, language and location selection, promotional banners, product category sections, and a detailed footer — all designed to mimic the original website’s layout and design. No JavaScript or frameworks were used. The project helped strengthen my understanding of layout techniques, responsive design concepts, Flexbox, and UI structure.
